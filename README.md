# invoice-genie-2.0
In this repo I am adding backend to the original invoice genie web app
I am making a node js backend for invoice genie app using which users can login, logout and store their created invoices to the database and it can be accessed whenever the user wants.

Doing this to learn node js to develop backends for my future projects. :smiley:
